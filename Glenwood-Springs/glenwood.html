      <h3>Day 1</h3>
    <p>Kandace and I have been working a lot lately.  One night back in september we started talking about Amtrack.  I had told her about the trip my mother and I took from Salt Lake City to New York state when I was about ten years old.  Kandace seemed very excited to take a train ride, so she started lookin at train rides and destinations.  After some serious descussions we decided to take an Amtrack Vacations to Glenwood springs Colorado.</p>
    <p>Our train ride was to start in the wee hours on October 3<sup>rd</sup> 2019, or so we thought.  We had packed the night before and wanted to be ready to Uber to the staion and get on the train at 3:00am.  When we got to the station we were informed that the train was going to be a little late.  So at about 5:00am we finally got on the train. (The California Zepher - Going east bound) 
      <p>The train left Salt Lake City and traveled to Provo for a breif stop, before heading towards Spanish Fork and up "Soldier Summit Pass."  Half way up the pass the sun started to peak out from behind the mountian, and by the time we got to the top the sun was up.  It was a beautiful morning, it was cool outside and the heat from the sun was causing fog to rise off the winding river next to us. This is when we decided that we should check out the dining car.  We sat in the dining car and had a decent breakfast watching the sun rise over the valleys and mountains thought Helper and Price, UT.
    <p>After leaving Price we went back to our seats to enjoy the rest of the ride to Genwood Springs.  The train took us from Price to Green River, UT following mountain valleys and hill top views.  Shortly before Green River the moutain terrain changed from mountainious to desert, following the green river.  In Green River another train stop (no leaving the train herr), we turned due east and headed towards Colorado.  An hour later we were running paralle to the mighty Colorado River.  The next stop was Grand Junction, CO.  This was a stop we could get off the train and streach our legs for a few minutes before moving on.  Between Grand Junction and Glenwood Springs it was mid after noon and the sun was showing the beuaty of the colorado river and the surrounding area.  About an hour before our final destination the train stoped and we heard, "Sorry for the delay, there has been a rock slide ahead and we need to check it out before we can proceed." We sat in the canyon with 200 foot shear cliffs on either side, small valley and the river.  This was one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen.  Just the valley and the train, nature at its finest.  After waiting about 30 minutes the train finally started to move, and about an hour later we were at the station in Glenwood Springs Colorado.</p>

    <div class="main-section2">
      <p>Arriving in Glenwood springs we were greeted with small mountain town nestled in between mountains and the Colorado River running through the town.  It was a really nice day mid 60’s and sunny when we got off the platform.  After a few minutes the driver for our rental car “We pick you up…” picked us up and transported us to the rental car lot across town.  We went in thinking that we were going to receive an economy car, but our salesmen said “I am sorry we do not have any economy cars, how would you like this Jeep wrangler instead? Saying sure that will work and thinking “Hell yea we will take the wrangler.” Finishing up the paperwork the salesmen must have known I wanted to take the Wrangler out, he started suggesting trails in the local area.  “Can we take a rented Jeep out on the trails?” Apparently you can, just get the full damage insurance.  So we finished up and headed to our hotel to unpack and unwind.  Before we got to comfortable we started to think about what we were going to do about dinner.  Kandace and I were both tired from work the previous day and the lack of sleep before getting on the train.  So, we decided that we were going to go to the store, buy some snacks and relax for the night before heading out early the next day.

      <h3>Day 2</h3>
      <p>One of the main reasons that we had chosen Glenwood Springs was to visit the springs and the cave system.  We had not thought about off-roading, but during the night we decided that was what we were going to do.  I had picked out a trail that ran from the town and went up the side of the mountain to an elevation of 11,000 ft.  So after having a great breakfast at The 19th Street Diner we started our off-road adventure.  </p>
      <img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/glenwood-springs/briandriving.jpg?raw=true" alt="brian driving" class="img2">
<p>The Transfer Trail starts on highway 6 in front of the Glenwood Springs Adventure Park.  Turning off the road the trail is a wide dirt lane used for Simi-trucks.  This wide lane goes up about 5 miles and climbs in elevation 3,000 ft., which ends in large dirt parking lot.  Off-roaders, this is the place to switch to four-wheel drive.  Continuing on the road it becomes a single lane Jeep trail.  The lane is not rocky but swells up and down as much as 10ft while climbing.  At the 8-mile mark, you will be at 10,000 ft. and on the edge of a cliff.  The road is wide enough for an off-road vehicle, be careful of traffic coming the other way.  There are no pull offs and no way to turn around.  At the 12-mile mark, elevation 10,400 ft., there is a pull of and trailhead to the left.  We stopped here for about a half an hour taking pictures and just enjoying the view. The trail continues for another 3 miles loosing and gaining elevation until the last mile, which is a 9-13% up grade and all rocks and boulders.  The last mile is challenging if you are not familiar with off-roading or your vehicle.  Now at the end of the trail there is a little camping are and pull out in the aspen trees.  Having gone in early October, the leaves were changing and beautiful.  We stayed there for a while listening to the silence and taking more photos.

<p>At this point we had a decision to make, continue down the backside of the mountain or head back the way we came.  Not having a good map, cell service, or were not prepared for overlanding in a rented Wrangler, we decided to head back to town.  Down was a lot harder, but went a lot faster.  There are some steep grades on this trail, exceeding 15%.  Thank god for all the features on the Wrangler. It took about an hour to return to town, and while we were descending, Kandace and I started talking about buying a Jeep for further adventures.  If this stock Wrangler Sport S could do what I had just put it through, I was sold. </p>

      <p>Having returned to our hotel it was about 1:00pm.  Too early for dinner and not enough time to do anything else or so I thought.  Kandace said, “We still have these vouchers for the caves, I would like to see them.”  So we walked from our hotel to the “Glenwood Springs Adventure Park.”  The vouchers got us in at no cost.  The nice person at the counter said that the gondolas were not running today due to high winds, which we had experienced at 10,000 ft. as well.  Therefore, we were going to have to ride up in a shuttle.  A note about the adventure park, it is not in town, but about 2,000 ft. above the town and on the side of the mountain. 
        <img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/glenwood-springs/cave5.jpg?raw=true" alt="" class="img5">
<p>So we got into a large bus and started up the mountain, using (ironically) the same road we had just been on earlier.  The driver was crazy he flew up the road for about 2 miles at 60 mph.  I was glad that we made it alive.  The park was small about an acre in size, with a few carnival rides and an alpine slide; all dressed up in western theme. Kandace and I were not very interested in the rides, but wanted to see the caves.  So we headed in that direction.  There are two caves in the park, “The Fairy Caves,” and “Kingsrow Cave.”  The fairy cave were first and on the top side of the park.  Our tour guide was amazing; he was very knowledgeable about the cave, the town and the history of the area.  Unfortunately, having been to Timpanogos Cave in Utah, I was not that impressed.  Although the history of the cave was interesting.  After the first cave, we moved on to the second, Kingsrow.  This cave was amazing, it blew Timpanogos out of the water, pictures and words cannot describe this cave “System.” Apparently, the cave that we were in was a huge system of caves that went on for several miles further.  Kandace and I were completely blow away, having seen the first cave compared to the second.  This tour is highly recommended, but do see both caves. </p>

<p>When the second tour ended it was about 5:00pm and the park was beginning to close for the day. (Winter hours) Kandace and I headed for the gift shop for a magnet and some water.  While we were in the gift shop, an announcement came over the PA.  “Because the wind has died down the gondola is running again.” Kandace was not excited about this announcement.  However, we still needed to make it down the mountain, walking was not an option.  We walked over the gondola and hopped into a car.  Going down was Ok at the top of the hill, but as we got further down the mountain. The wind picked up and started to sway the car, by the time we got to the middle part, the car was rocking.  In fact rocking bad enough that it stopped running.  Apparently if the wind gusts more than 50 mph the ride automatically stops.  Let us just say, Kandace was not a happy camper being stuck 40 ft. about the mountain and about halfway down.  Eventually the ride started again, slowly at first and then a little faster, and we did make down the mountain.  When car opened at the bottom, Kandace shot out and said, “Let’s not do that again!”  Nevertheless, we both had mad it down alive.  Looking back at the gondola, we walked back to our hotel to clean up and get some dinner. </p>

    <div class="main-section5 dinner">
      <p> Most of the day we had asked the local people of the town where the best place to eat was. Most all of the locals agreed, Juicy Lucy’s Steakhouse was the place to go.  So once cleaned up we hopped back into the jeep and headed downtown.  Parking downtown was bad; we eventually found a spot about four blocks away and walked to restaurant. There was a small wait for dinner, but Kandace and I sat out in the common area of the street and people watched.  The restaurant looked like it could have been an old saloon 120 years ago.  The food smelled really good from the street and even better from the restaurant. We sat down and the waiters came right away.  We place an appetizer order for mussels, and both ordered steaks for dinner.  The mussels were amazing, cooked to perfection and just the right flavors.  When the steaks came, they looked wonderful.  Checking the doneness, which was right on, I had a piece.  It was one of the best steaks I have had in a long time. Both Kandace and I enjoyed them.  After a good meal and desert for two.  We walked back to jeep and headed back to the hotel for the night.</p>

      <h2>Day 3</h2>
     <p> Waking up the next morning, we had a few things that we needed to do.  The first thing was breakfast.  So we stopped at a regional coffee shop and had breakfast.  Talking about the previous day and everything that we needed to be done today.  After breakfast, we went and checked out of the hotel and then took a drive around the town to kill some time.  Actually, we wanted to see what the jeep could do on the highway and local roads.  An hour or so later we turned in the Jeep to the rental car place.  Funny story here about the rental.  Apparently, you are not supposed to take rental cars off-roading.  The gentleman that was taking in cars for the day had told the customer in front of us (that had rented a Ford F150), that the rental contract would not allow him to take the vehicle off-road.  Of course, here we are, Jeep covered in dust and dirt, light pin striping though the dust.  The return person just gave us quick look and said we were good to go.  So we will keep that in mind for later.  
	<p>The rental car shuttled us to the train station across town.  So when the train came we were ready to go.  The train was scheduled to arrive at 1:45 pm, but in Amtrak fashion showed up about 3:45pm. Therefore, we boarded the train and found our seats.  Shortly after leaving the station, there was announcement about dinner and making reservations.  Kandace went to the dining car and got a time for dinner.  We sat and watched the world go by, but in reverse.  Shortly before reaching Grand Junction, Colorado our names were called for dinner.  Here is a very important note.  You must eat communally for dinner.  That means that because we were just two people, we had to eat with complete strangers.  I do not have a problem with this, but it should be disclosed beforehand.  All Kandace and I wanted was a quite dinner just the two of us.  So after looking at the menu and not being that impressed with the food for the price, on top of the seating arrangements.  We excused ourselves and went back to our seats.  
	<p>By the time we got back to our seats, the sun was starting to go down.  We were well past Grand Junction, and by the time we made it Green River Utah, it was dark.  Being dark and quiet, other than the train sounds we both drifted in and out of sleep.  You could tell that the engineer was trying to make up time because the train was moving fast, and had a lot more rocking right and left.  A few hours later we began to see the lights of Provo Utah. Knowing that or adventure was almost at an end, we started to wake up and watch the world again. About forty-five minutes later, we were pulling into the Salt Lake Station, where we departed.  The train had made up a tremendous amount of time; we were only about fifteen minutes behind schedule.  Collecting our bags and moving off the platform, I confirmed an Uber to take us home.  Which arrived rapidly and we were home within a matter of minutes. 
	<p>Even though it had been a very busy weekend, both Kandace and I were relaxed.  I guess that this little vacation was what we needed.
