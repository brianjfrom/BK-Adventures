        <p>Hello, My name is Brian.  My wife, Kandace, and I have been married since 2001.  We have shared many great adventures together over the years.  While we were younger we loved to camp and hike.  We had many trips throughout southern Utah while dating and during the first year of our marriage.   We have explored Moab, St. George, Zion National Park, and had one very memorable trip to Bryce Canyon National Park.

<p>About a year after we married, our one and only child, Sarah, was born.  After that auspicious event, much of our camping and hiking days were over.  The sacrifice was worth it, as our beautiful little girl was the light of our life.  Unfortunately, during several moves due to military service, most of our outdoor gear was either lost or destroyed.

<p>Sarah is almost an adult now, and we regrettably have never shared our camping love with her.  We still took many vacations over the years, including a cruise when Sarah was around five years old.  We have also, as a family, been to Texas, Hawaii, Washington State and of course we explored our final moving destination, the wonderful state of Utah.  We love to travel to see various musical concerts as well.

<p>Now that Sarah is about to venture out on her own, we have been considering what we are going to do now.  After a beautiful and enjoyable trip to Glenwood Springs, Colorado, we decided that we would love to buy a nice Jeep Wrangler and modify it to start doing Overland adventures. Much of this upcoming blog will be about the journeys we are going to take and the joys and trials of buying and modifying our Jeep. <br>- 10-26-2019</p>
