        <p><span class="about-span">Brian and Kandace</span> have been married since 2001 and have shared many great adventures. While we we dating we loved to camp and hike. We had many trips to Southern Utah. Exploring Arches/Moab, St George and Zion NP
          and a very memorable trip to Bryce National park.</p>
        <p>About a year after getting married we had our only child (Sarah), and much of our camping and hiking days ended. Much of our camping grear was lost or distroyed on several moves during our military days.</p>
        <p>Sarah is almost an adult now but we really never did the camping and hiking trips with her. Although there were many vacations, we took and cruise when Sarah was about five years old. We all have been to Texas, Utah, Hawaii, Washington State and
          many others for vacation. As well, we like to travel for music concerts.</p>
        <p>Now that Sarah is about to be on her own we have been considering what we are going to do now. After a trip in October 2019 We decided that we whould like to buy and nice Jeep Wrangler and Modify it to do overland adventures. Much of this up coming
          blog will be about adventures that we are going to take and the adventure of buying and modifying a Jeep. <br>- 10-26-2019</p>
