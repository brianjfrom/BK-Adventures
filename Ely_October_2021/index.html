            <p>Covid has been a real pain in the ass. Mask mandates, travel restrictions and vaccines have kept families
                apart. As it was, I had not seen my Mom and Tom since the Thanksgiving trip in 2019. So, upon one of our
                many phone conversations, we decided to take a trip to Nevada, Ely to be specific. We decided to meet in
                the town of McGill, Nevada, on October 1, 2021</p>
        </div>
        <div class="second_text">
            <p>Leaving Salt Lake City around 9:00 AM, after stopping briefly for gas, we headed out of town on the 201
                freeway and met up with interstate-80 at the “Great Salt Lake.” The lake was at an all time low, from
                the interstate, the lake was almost a mile away. Remembering the flooding in the early 80s, when the
                lake took out the road in the same location. This was a drastic change. Heading past Tooele, towards
                Wendover, the landscape changes from city to dry desert and eventually to a salted wasteland where
                nothing grows. Passing the concrete tree in the desert, we headed into Wendover. We filled up on fuel
                and food before heading to our next location.</p>
            <p> Gone was the interstate with its multiple lanes, and onto US 93 Alt South. It's a two-lane highway that
                moves its way down the eastern part of Nevada, highlighting towns such as Ely, Caliente, Crystal
                Springs, before terminating at I-15 north of Las Vegas. Not seeing a car for the first twenty miles on
                US 93, the road curved around hills, climbing and falling. Eventually, the road and landscape flattened
                out and you could see for miles and miles ahead, nothing but desert with mountains in the background.
                Traveling for about 2 hours we made it to McGill Nevada. </p>

                <p>Meeting up with Yhama and Daideo  in McGill, we wandered the main street for about twenty minutes.  Main street is small with only a handful of buildings, The McGill Club, The Rexall Drugstore Museum, a closed movie theater (built at the turn of the century), and a post office.  Not what you would call a modern metropolis, but a cool little town in the desert. Ambling down main street, Tom pointed out his old haunts, and explained the history of the town he had lived in as a child. Getting back to our vehicles, we drove around for a few minutes before heading out of town.

                Backtracking on US 93, we turned off on Highway 486, a dirt road that went behind the mountain from Mcgill to Ely.  A few minutes after entering the road, we detoured to a side road that took us to Bird Creek campground.  Traveling up the road for about 3 miles we stopped at the camping/picnic area as a herd of deer crossed the road in front of us.  A couple of bucks and many does, surprising us as we entered the area.  We found a few tables near the creek and made some sandwiches. Kandace and Sarah went exploring the creek.

                After lunch we cleaned up and headed back to Highway 486, following it south.  After climbing up in elevation the trees started to expose their colors.  Yellows and reds among the green pine trees.  Sadly there were many dying aspens that had black leaves.  Reaching the summit of the mountain at around 9,000 ft in elevation, we stopped to view the world.  Overlooking the valleys below there was a great transition of the landscape, colored aspens and pines, rocky crags and valley grass expanded below us.  Sarah decided that she wanted to hike further up the mountains for a better picture opportunity.  Having explored the area for about 45 minutes we got back on the road and continued to follow it south.  Dropping down into the lower elevations we passed the overlook for Cave Lake and later traveled through “Tamberlain Canyon,” and back to US 93, just south of Ely.  Going north on the paved road for about ten minutes, we ended up at the KOA of Ely, where Yhama and Daideo  were staying.  After getting them settled into the KOA, we headed into town where we had a hotel room.

                The Holiday Inn Express was about fifteen minutes from the KOA, but for a town Ely's size a very nice hotel. We checked in and took our stuff to the room and headed back to the KOA.   When we got back, we had dinner, an oven roasted chicken and a nice salad and then we talked about life as the sun went down.  Soon the night was pitch black and so many stars were out.  We stood there for a few hours just talking and watching the stars.  Eventually it got cold and everybody wanted to go indoors.  So we split up for the night and headed for the hotel.  Once at the hotel we kicked back and relaxed for a few hours watching TV, until exhaustion set in and we turned in.

                The morning in Ely was cold, waking up and getting out of the room by 8:00 AM. The temperature was in the twenties.   Stopping at the continental breakfast we had some food and coffee to start the day and after eating checked out of the hotel.  Heading to the west side of Ely on Highway 50 we met Yhama and Daideo  at the “Historic Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall.”  The Hotel Nevada was built in 1929 and was the tallest building in Nevada until 1931.  We went inside this old hotel. It was interesting to see the lobby and gambling hall, which had not changed in almost a hundred years.  There was a large stairway leading to the hotel on the second floor.  The interior was small and the rooms seemed small as well, but the stairs only led to the second floor.  If you were staying in the hotel above the second floor, there was a fire-escape leading to the other floors, kinda scary.  However, looking at the hotel's website the rooms look nice, and maybe there was another stairwell. The history of the hotel can be seen at Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall Wiki.

                Leaving the hotel, we headed north-west on Highway 50 about ten to fifteen miles away and then pulled off onto a dirt road that led to Garnet Hill.  We pulled into a dirt parking lot on top of the mountain, looking in every direction down the mountain.  Tom and Jewd came over and handed us some tools, (a trowel, hammer, etc). Then we hiked down the hill for a bit until we came to a rock pile.  We started digging into the ground and around the rock pile looking for crimson colored garnets.  We dug in the ground for a few hours, finding a few smaller garnets.  However, Yhama had found a few really nice larger garnets in her search. With hurting and bleeding hands we decided to call it quits and headed back to the vehicles. After hydrating and talking for a few minutes, we watched a lizard sunning on the wall, completely motionless for several minutes, Sarah snapping a few photos of the lizard and surrounding area.  We decided that it was time to leave, which meant splitting up and heading home.  We said our goodbyes and we headed back to Ely, and Tom and Jewd headed for home.

                    Stopping briefly in Ely to refuel and air up the tires, we went back towards Wendover on US 93 north. After a few hours of driving we stopped in Wendover, UT for fuel and food again.  The day was warm as we ate our food in the car with the windows down for some cooling effects.  Once finished, we got back onto I-15 and headed east to home, passing through the salt desert and past the concrete tree, where we eventually met up with the lake and onto the 201 freeway.  Salt Lake City was colder and it had been raining that day so the streets were wet.  There was a lot of traffic on the road, so it took some time to finally get home.  Getting home we were greeted by a very upset kitty cat. We unloaded our stuff and relaxed for the rest of the night. We knew that the next day would be back to the normal grind.

                <p>
                    We had a lot of fun on this trip, seeing new parts of the country, off-roading, garnet hunting, and just having a good time with family.
