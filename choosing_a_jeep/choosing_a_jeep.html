    <section class="intro">
   <p> After our recent trip to Glenwood Springs in Colorado, Kandace and I decided that we wanted a Jeep Wrangler, but which one?  Should we buy new or old, two or four door, and which trim.  There was a lot of research that we needed to perform. </p>
   <br>
<p>We knew that we wanted a Jeep Wrangler, so that was easy.  We also knew that we wanted a four door as well, so that eliminated some of the questions.  So the next question was new or old.  New is nice, but also very expensive.  The Wrangler sport starting at $23,000 and the Rubicon starting at $40,000 with high-end models running as much as $60,000.  </p>
 <br>
<p>The newer models Wranglers are the JL from 2018 to present. The next model down is the JK from 2008 to 2018 and one of the bestselling Wranglers of all time. The JK was the first to offer a four door Wrangler also known as an “Unlimited.”  Regardless of the JL or JK model Jeep Wranglers hold their values very well and have one of the best resale values.  So a JK will cost you a good sum of money.  If you are not looking for JL/JK there are earlier models that can be considered.</p>

    <section class="end">
     <p> So when all was said and done, we decided that we wanted a JL or Jk Rubicon Unlimited.  Looking at our finances, we were sure that we could buy a JK but would have to save for a JL.  Not wanting to wait we went out looking for a JK Rubicon. </p>
      <br>
 
      <p>On November 15, 2019, we bought an Anvil Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Unlimited. </p>
