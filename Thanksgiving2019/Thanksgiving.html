      <p>Having worked the last seven years of Thanksgivings and Christmasas.  This is the first year that the family could travel for the holiday.  So we decided that we were going to visit my parents in the St. George area. Having worked on wednesday we decided that traveling on thursday would be the smarter choice, or so we thought.<p>  Getting up early on Thanksgiving  Thursday to head south we were greeted with a fresh dusting of snow.  We decided that we would load up and head out.  Leaving Salt Lake City the roads were a mess and the snow was heavy, two to three inches on the roads and snowing heavy.  Once on the Interstate traffic was slow from SLC to Nephi and slowed to a crawl on the pass south of there.  After heading down the other side of the pass the weather got better and the speeds started to increase.  
      <p>Raining mostly travel from Fillmore to Cedar City, was wet but not unsafe or dangerous.  Dropping in elevation from Cedar City to St. George it began to rain, and the closer that we got to our destination the harder the rain fell.  When we got to our destination the dry washes were not dry and the streets had small rivers running down them.  Pulling up to my parents house we got out and headed in from the rain.  Surprisingly within ten minutes the rain had stopped and the sun tried to peak out from the clouds.

        After gathering our stuff from the Jeep, we sat and had a wonderful Thanksgiving, having great food, conversation and drink the day amazing.

      Waking the following morning to a breakfast of bagels, cream cheese and fruit, we headed out in search of adventure.  Heading out of St George and towards Snow Canyon on Highway 18, the weather was cold and damp but there was no rain or snow.  As we continued on the highway towards Vayo, Utah. The weather turned a little wet, first with rain then snow.  By the time we made our turnoff on Lower Sand Cove Road, there was a good two to three inches on the pavement.  We made our turn and headed west towards Gunlock, Utah.  </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1201.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1201.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="driving"></a>
      <p>Lower Sand Cove Road started as a wide packed dirt road. With the snow on the ground and the rain the previous day the road was muddy, but not deep.  Halfway between the turnoff and Gunlock the road narrowed and started dropping in hairpin turns until down towards the river level.  Here the mud was deep and it was thick and the Wrangler powered right through it and back up the other side.  At the top of the hill there was a caravan of cars going the other way, and leading it was a Honda Pilot.  All I could think was, “Yea, he’s buried, he's going to have to call Matt."  That was the last person we saw on the road until Gunlock.  When we met the road again, we turned south and headed toward the reservoir of Gunlock.  Here we stopped for a few minutes to check out how muddy the Jeep was and use the restrooms.  From the reservoir we continued south through the Native American Land (Reservation land) and past the towns of Shem and Shivwits until connecting to Old Highway 91.  On the old highway we headed southeast back towards St George, skirting Ivans and Santa Clara, Utah.  </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1210.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1210.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="damjeep1"></a>
      <p>We arrived in St. George and were heading back to my parents house for the day when the suggestion of another trail was mentioned.  From West St. George we headed towards Bloomington, Utah, where we ended up in some subdivision, asking if we were in the right place.  After a few minutes of driving, the street opened up to a huge area with roads and trails going in every direction. We followed the main trail that turned to dirt and mud almost immediately.  It wound up around a large area that was a recreation area for ATV’s, but had a few off-road trails leading north and south.  After climbing a few steep and rocky hills to test the Jeep and driver’s skill. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1237.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1237.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="jeepmud1"></a> </span>We decided that we would continue on the OHV trail for a while.  The trail wove through the red dirt hills of the area, up on plateaus and down on to the riverbeds.  After about 10 miles we stopped to take pictures, and the party decided that they were ready to head home. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1238.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1238.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="desert1"></a> </span> So we reversed course and headed toward home base.  Before reaching home, we decided that it was probably a good idea to wash some of the mud off of the Jeep.  <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1241.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1241.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="mud1"></a></span>Finding an automatic car wash we ran the the Wrangler through. After the wash finished the majority of the mud had come off and we headed home.  Once home we realized that not all of the mud had come off, in fact the carwash was a useless encounter.  There was still mud on the fenders, sides and undersides of the vehicle, and would need serious scrubbing; but not today. </p>

       Dinner the second night was good, we ordered from an Indian restaurant that was either Bombay House, or part of the company.  The food was good and the conversation about the days activities filled the house until it was time for bed.

      <p>Waking the following morning, breakfast was fruit, granola, yogurt and a hot cup of coffee.  Over breakfast, my parents decided that they were not going to be joining us on our adventure today.  So Kandace, Sarah and I headed out for another adventurous day. After getting fuel we headed back to the area in Bloomington where we had been the day before.  Starting back on the same trial as the day before, we had decided that we would follow the road to where it ended.  Either on a dead end or another highway. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1255.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1255.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="airDown"></a></span> We had also decided that we should air-down the tires on the Jeep just in case of whatever terrain we may encounter.  We quickly arrived at the point we turned around the day before.  It was at the top of high plateau that overlooked much of the valley below. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1252.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1252.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="road"></a> </span> Heading further down the road dropped into a very rocky wash, which was a lot of fun to drive. the wash the road eventually started to turn uphill, and stayed going uphill until we reached snow.  The trail turned in all directions but eventually turned south towards the Virgin River. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1275.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1275.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="snow1"></a></span> Continuing on the trail after reaching the peak of the mountain, and few 4Wlo moments to traverse the trail.  The trail headed down again, and after about two or three miles had us looking at the Virgin River Gorge.  Abruptly the trail ended and there was a large cliff that you could not drive down.  We decided that now was a good time to take a break and take more pictures.  We had gone about Twenty Five miles down this trail, so we sat there and enjoyed the view.  After a while the weather turned cold and black clouds were rolling over the mountain that we had just come down from.  Heading back seemed like a good idea.  Back up the mountain we reached the snow quickly, but the clouds did not unleash.  Heading back down the other side the clouds changed direction and headed the other way. <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1284.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1284.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="snow2"></a></span> Getting out of the snow line, Kandace asked, “Can I drive?”  I pulled over and she got behind the wheel, she did a fantastic job.  When we got back to the entry area, she asked if she could climb some of the steep rocky hills, like I had done the day before.  So I pointed to an area and got her lined up.  The hill was about 150 yards at a 50 degree angle, rocky and wet.  Talking her through the gearing and locking of the differentials, she headed up the hill.  By the time she reached to top she was grinning from ear to ear.  She quickly wanted to go back down the hill she had just climbed.  <span><a href="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1264.JPG?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/brianjfrom/photos_for-_sites/blob/master/blog_photos/Thanksgiving2019/IMG_1264.JPG?raw=true" alt="" class="desert2"></a></span>So pointing her in the opposite direction, she lined up to go down the hill. She was great, didn’t even flinch, she was down the hill like a pro.   We headed back to the staging area and aired the tires to pressure, and then headed to a car wash to free the mud.

      <p>We decided that the automatic washer was not to be used for this kind of mud.  So we found a manual wash with a high pressure sprayer.  First things first, get the mud off of the underside, fenders and sides of the Jeep.  After about fifteen minutes of high pressure the majority of the mud was gone, and all that was left to do was soap up and finish the wash.  The jeep looked almost as good as new.  Heading back to my parents house, we pulled into the driveway, and I realized that I miss a few spots.  The front under panel was still caked with red mud.   “Oh well,” I thought, have to get it next time I wash it.

      <p>Waking up the next morning to return home. We said our goodbyes and thanks for the weekend.  Packing up the jeep, we noticed that it rained the night before, and a red muddy streak was under the jeep, down my parents driveway.  At least some of the mud was coming off, apologizing for their driveway we reversed and headed north towards home.  Leaving St George, the weather was sunny, but cold and the roads were dry.  Smooth driving until we hit Pintura, Utah.  All of a sudden, traffic that had been going 80mph stopped with an endless river of cars.  Looking on google while we waited, there was an accident eight miles up the interstate and the traffic was not moving.  After forty-five minutes of waiting, the cars started to slowly move 2-5mph, and after about fifteen minutes of that speed up to 40 mph.  By the time we made it to mile marker that had the accident, traffic was moving 80mph again and there was no sign of and accident.  We continued on, past Cedar City, Beaver and in Fillmore we stopped for gas and food.  The stop was brief and back onto the road.  We continued on, not stopping until we were home.

      <p>Having had a great weekend with family and the adventures that we took. We were glad to be home.  A day after we got home it rained and snowed in the Salt Lake Valley, red mud was everywhere.  I pass by the mud stains on the concrete and smile thinking of that weekend. </p>
